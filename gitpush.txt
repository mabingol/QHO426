A list of common Git commands can be found here (https://git-scm.com/docs). For this module, we will use the followig commands:

git status - checks the status.  Indicates which files/folders have been newly created or changed.  This is a useful command to use before and after staging changes.
git add . - stages all changes.  This command will need to be used before the changes can be committed.
git commit -m "your message" - commits the changes.  You should replace "your message" with a suitable message indicating what has changed and why.
git push - push everything from the local repository to the remote repository.  We will do this at least once at the end of each lesson.

Some student are getting this bug, which makes git unsure of who you are.
Here are steps I recommended to others, which seem to work:
In Command Prompt type in:
git config user.name "name"
(replacing the “name” with your GitHub username, still in quotation marks)
Confirm with Enter and then type in the second command:
git config user.email “name@changeme.com”
(replacing “name@changeme.com” with your email, still in quotation marks)
Confirm with Enter.
Let me know if that works.
